Health data: generating causal curves and examining mediation
===================================================================

Children, blood lead levels, and cognitive performance
------------------------------------------------------

To provide an end-to-end example of the sorts of analyses `cause-curve` can be used for, we'll
begin with an epidemiology topic. The full  Specific examples of the individual
`causal-curve` tools are available elsewhere in this documentation.

Despite the banning of the use of lead-based paint and the use of lead in gasoline, lead exposure
remains
